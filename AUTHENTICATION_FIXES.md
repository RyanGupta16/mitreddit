# 🔧 MIT Reddit Authentication Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Rate Limiting Problem**
**Issue**: The authentication endpoints had very restrictive rate limits (5 requests per 15 minutes), causing legitimate users to get blocked.

**Fix**: 
- Increased auth rate limit from 5 to 50 requests per 15 minutes
- Location: `server/src/server.js` line 55-60

### 2. **HTML Form Missing Name Attributes**
**Issue**: The login and signup forms in `index.html` didn't have `name` attributes on input fields, making FormData extraction unreliable.

**Fix**:
- Added `name="email"`, `name="password"`, `name="name"`, etc. to all form inputs
- Updated option values to be more descriptive
- Location: `client/index.html` lines 579-623

### 3. **JavaScript Form Data Extraction**
**Issue**: The auth.js was using fragile placeholder-based selectors to extract form data instead of using proper FormData.

**Fix**:
- Updated `handleLogin()` and `handleSignup()` to use `FormData` API
- More reliable data extraction using field names
- Location: `client/js/auth.js` lines 100-150

### 4. **API Response Format Mismatch**
**Issue**: The frontend JavaScript expected user data in `response.data`, but the server returned it directly in `response.user` and `response.token`.

**Fix**:
- Updated `authenticateUser()` and `createUser()` methods to match actual API response format
- Correct token handling and user data extraction
- Location: `client/js/auth.js` lines 341-375

## ✅ Current Status

### 🚀 Server Status
- ✅ Running on port 5000 (PID varies)
- ✅ Supabase database connected
- ✅ All authentication endpoints functional
- ✅ Rate limits adjusted for normal usage

### 🔐 Authentication System
- ✅ User registration (signup) working
- ✅ User login working  
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ Form validation (client and server-side)
- ✅ Unique username generation
- ✅ Analytics tracking on auth events

### 🎯 Testing Results
All authentication endpoints tested successfully:
- Health check: ✅ Connected
- Signup: ✅ Creates users in Supabase
- Login: ✅ Validates credentials and returns JWT
- Profile access: ✅ Token-based authentication works

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Open the main application**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Click the login button** (user icon in top-right)
3. **Switch to "Sign Up" tab**
4. **Fill out the form** with:
   - Full Name: Any name
   - Email: Must end with `@learner.manipal.edu`  
   - Branch: Select from dropdown
   - Year: Select from dropdown
   - Password: Minimum 6 characters
   - Confirm Password: Must match password

5. **Click "Sign Up"** - Should create account and automatically log in
6. **Test login** with the credentials you just created

## 🔧 Technical Improvements Made

### Server-Side (Node.js + Supabase)
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Secure password hashing
- Rate limiting for security
- Analytics tracking integration
- JWT token security

### Client-Side (JavaScript)
- Robust form data extraction
- Better error messaging
- Loading states during auth operations  
- Token management and storage
- API response handling
- Form validation feedback

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- User table with proper constraints
- Unique email and username enforcement
- Password hash storage (never plain text)
- User metadata (branch, year, etc.)
- Timestamps and audit fields

## 🎉 Ready for Production

The authentication system is now fully functional and ready for real users. The issues that were causing the "Server error during login" and non-working signup button have been resolved.

**Next steps**: Users can now successfully create accounts and log in to the MIT Reddit platform!
